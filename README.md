The Adventuring Party Planner

At the very core, Dungeons and Dragons and other tabletop role playing games are based on storytelling. The players work together to overcome fierce battles, daunting quests, powerful monsters, labyrinthian dungeons, and much more. The Game Master or “GM” is tasked with creating a captivating and fresh story for the group. This can be a daunting task for even a seasoned player. 
Our companion app, The Adventuring Party Planner, helps the GM create an immersive fantasy world. Our app walks the GM through the storytelling process and creates monsters to fight and loot to award a victorious group. The application aids in the storytelling with a multitude of options for story events. These events are built once the GM chooses from the seven different possible types. There is also functionality to create non-player characters which can be a very time consuming task for a GM. We also have included a feature that allows the user to write down important notes about the campaign. By making all of this information easier to access and reference, we believe that we took out some of the complexity that is often frustrating for new and veteran players.
